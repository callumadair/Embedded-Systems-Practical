# Lab2: dotDevice

## Task 3

The tinypico has memory constraints so storing the commands on the dotdevice means that we avoid this issue.
You dont need to rewrite delay codes using the state commands. 
The delay between commands is constant using the dotdevice's memory, meaning that with the tinypico you can have slightly more control over command execution time.
