## Your EmSys Logbook

In this repository you can commit your lab assignments for assessment. In each of the lab subfolders you can include:
* Arduino sketches, if relevant for the assignment.
* Screenshots, which can be displayed in the README.md file.
* Bits of text or measurement data, again if relevant for the assignment.

You will find a subdirectory for each of the labs:
* [/lab1](lab1/)
* [/lab2](lab2/)
* [/lab3](lab3/)
* [/lab4](lab4/)
* [/lab5](lab5/)
* [/lab6](lab6/)
